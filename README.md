This is written in Java. It includes a simple command line application for time entry. I used Eclipse to write in and started with a gradle file to setup the environment. As far as the requirements for the individual families, I noticed that Family B and C did not specify per hour rates for the "rest of the night" times. I decided to go with per hour rates as to not complicate the program any further. 

Thank you
